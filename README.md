# Weather Dashboard
In this project, I created a weather dashboard that is able to run in a web browser using dynamically updated html and css. This web app allows the user to search for a city to get the current weather along with a 5 day forecast. OpenWeather API was used to obtain the weather data for cities that the user searches for.

# Usage
This app functions using text entry of a city to display a detailed weather forecast for the curreny  day as well as a 5-day forecast. The 5-day forecast features Temperature, Wind, and Humidity as a prediction for the choosen city. Icons are next to the 5-day forecast items indicating the weather forecast.
