# Weather-Dashboard
In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that is able to run in a web browser using dynamically updated html and css. This web app allows the user to search for a city to get the current weather along with a 5 day forecast. OpenWeather API was used to obtain the weather data for cities that the user searches for.
